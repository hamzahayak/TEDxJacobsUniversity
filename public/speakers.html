                                In 2018, Jacobs alumna Tanja Anabelle Deisler started her own fashion brand, Corner Office. Annabelle’s brand focuses on sustainable production within the EU and nearshore, and it aims to be the one-stop shop for all things related to professional clothing for women. Corner Office doesn’t only sell clothes – it was conceived from a desire to boost confidence and pride, build a community of inspiring females, and empower women at the workplace.
                                After graduating from Jacobs, Anabelle continued her education at Hult International Business School and at MIT.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                Anabelle has a very curious, outgoing and inquisitive personality. Starting her career in Management Consulting at 23 in the engineering department, in a sector dominated by men, she found the atmosphere to be a little stiff and loaded with stereotypes and prejudice. She soon started gathering a series of experiences at work that made her become more and more critical about gender stereotypes and the role of women at the workplace, and she developed an interest in collecting experiences from other women in other contexts as well.

                                data-bs-speakerDetails="Alexandra Sophie is a French artist and photographer. At home all day long as she stopped school early due to her autism which did not let her go out, it is in her garden surrounded by flowers and the only presence of her younger sisters that she picks up her first camera in which her light sensitivity will be put at its best.
                                <br/><br/>
                                It quickly turns into a strength as she learns to master it, and her colorful work, described as sensual, fresh and feminine, entwining humans and nature is recognized by industry leaders. At the age of 22, her regular clients include Vogues and Harper's Bazaar internationally and soon, Forbes names her one of the 30 under 30.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Alexandra now lives with her husband and her two homeschooled sons in a wide garden where they hope to be living in as much self-sufficiency as possible around their beehives and vegetable patch. She regularly travels to universities and art festivals as a speaker and teacher, and to fields and forests around the planet to take photos within them.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Alexandra's work never went too far from the original flowers in her garden and whenever she is seen with a camera, it's only to question our identity and the word &quot;normal&quot; - which caused her a lot of troubles - beyond all its meanings : as humans through studies of the human body, paranormal stories and, of course, our place and rights within nature.
